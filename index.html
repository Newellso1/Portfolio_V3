            <h1>about me:</h1>
            <p>For the past 14 years, I have been working in the memorial masonry industry where I have honed my
                attention to detail and craftsmanship through to creating meaningful tributes for those who have lost
                those near to them. However, my passion for technology and design has led me to embark on new journey
                into the world of tech.
                I am mainly self taught but have recently started a 12 week bootcamp put on by The Coders Guild where I
                will hone the skills that I have already developed</p>

            <h1>Projects:</h1>
            <p>I have created several projects that showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS and .JS.
                I've included the relevant links in the descriptions but feel free to have a nosey round my <a

                    <h2>XP_Nostalgia</h2>
                    <p>This is the first project of mine where I have used jQuery, I have made a basic soundboard that
                        plays a handful of classic sound clips from the Windows XP operating system. I used jQuery to
                        easily play the sounds that had been loaded in my HTML place and to add a shake effect to
                        each button when clicked</p>

                <div class="project">
                    <h2>Headstone Tool</h2>
                    <p>I created a Headstone Creator web app utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project
                        allows users to customize headstone templates with personalized text and designs. It showcases
                        my current industry knowledge, and ability to implement user-friendly interfaces</p>

                    <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
                    <p>This is a Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a fun and
                        interactive
                        gaming experience played locally with an opponent. This project enabled me to enhance my
                        understanding of game logic and DOM manipulation</p>

                    <h2>Magic8ball</h2>
                    <p>One of my projects is a Magic 8 Ball web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It emulates
                        the classic fortune-telling toy by generating random answers to user questions. It was an
                        engaging project that allowed me to practice JavaScript logic and user interaction</p>
